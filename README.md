AI Techniques Used

Randomized Coin Generation: The game employs a randomized algorithm to populate the game state with coins of types (special, ordinary, blank) and values, ensuring unpredictable gameplay. This randomization is managed externally (assumed in a parent component) and passed to the GameBoard component via the gameState prop.
State-Driven Logic with React Hooks: Utilizes React‚Äôs useEffect and useState (inferred from parent component) to manage dynamic game states, such as coin reveals, score updates, and level progression, simulating an AI-driven environment with seamless transitions.
Timer-Based Feedback System: A 2.5-second timer (setTimeout) controls the reveal of enlarged coins after a click, providing automated feedback on points earned and updating the game state, mimicking an AI response for a polished experience.

Mechanism of the Game
Scoring System

Objective: Players flip coins to reveal their type (special, ordinary, or blank) and earn points to meet or exceed a level-specific score threshold to progress.
Coin Types and Points:

Special Coins: Yield higher points based on the level (4 points for Level 1, increasing to 6 points for Level 4). Each special coin features a unique orange-themed value and image (e.g., /assets/special-1.png).
Ordinary Coins: Yield moderate points (1.5 points for Level 1, increasing to 3 points for Level 4), represented by a single orange sign image (/assets/sign.png).
Blank Coins: Yield 0 points and trigger a "No Points!" message with a shake animation.

Tries Limit: Players have a limited number of tries (triesLeft in gameState), reducing by 1 per coin flip. The game ends if tries run out or the score threshold is met.
Win Condition: Players win a level by achieving the required score threshold (e.g., 10 points for Level 1, increasing to 16 for Level 4). The onLevelComplete callback advances the player to the next level.

AI Behaviors

No Direct AI Opponent: Sign Orange Coin uses AI techniques indirectly through randomized coin generation and state management rather than a traditional opponent. The game logic ensures fair coin distribution and consistent rule enforcement.

Automated Feedback: The timer-based system automatically reveals points or "No Points!" after a coin flip, enhancing immersion without requiring an active AI entity.
Game Over Logic: The system detects game-over conditions (tries exhausted or score threshold met) and updates the state to reflect win/loss, triggering level progression or game end.

Level Progression

Level Structure: The game features four levels, with increasing difficulty via higher score thresholds and potentially varied coin distributions.
Progression Mechanics: Upon reaching the score threshold for a level (e.g., 10 points for Level 1), the onLevelComplete callback advances the player to the next level with a higher threshold (e.g., 16 points for Level 4).

Dynamic Difficulty: Higher levels award more points for special and ordinary coins, but the increasing win threshold requires more strategic coin selection within the limited tries.
Game Over: The game ends when tries are exhausted without meeting the threshold or after completing all levels (assumed handled by the parent component), with the state updated to isGameOver.

Technical and Player Experience
Technical Details

Frontend: Built with React, using functional components and hooks (useEffect for timer-based state updates). The UI leverages Tailwind CSS (inferred from class names like bg-white, shadow-md) for a modern, responsive design with an orange citrus theme.
State Management: The GameBoard component receives gameState (containing coins, score, tries, level, etc.) and setGameState as props, ensuring modular state updates. The useEffect hook handles coin reveal animations and game logic transitions.

Coin System: Coins are defined with id, type (special, ordinary, blank), value, and revealed properties. Each type maps to specific orange-themed images and sound effects (e.g., /assets/blank.png, /sounds/coin-drop.mp3).
Sound Effects: Three audio files (blank-dud.mp3, coin-drop.mp3, special-chime.mp3) provide feedback for coin reveals, with mute support via localStorage. Error handling ensures playback failures don‚Äôt disrupt gameplay.
Animations: CSS animations (animate-shake for blank coins, animate-flip for scoring coins) enhance visual feedback. Enlarged coin overlays use a semi-transparent background (bg-black bg-opacity-50) for focus.
Responsive Design: The grid layout (game-grid) adapts to various screen sizes, with scalable coin sizes and centered overlays for accessibility.

Player Experience

Visual Appeal: The game features a clean, white background with subtle shadows and vibrant orange-themed coin images (e.g., special coins, sign coins, blank coins). Animations like shaking for blank coins and flipping for scoring coins add excitement.
Interactivity: Players click coins to reveal them, with immediate feedback via enlarged coin displays showing points (e.g., "+4" for a special coin) or "No Points!" for blanks. Sound effects enhance immersion, with a mute option for accessibility.

Strategic Depth: Players must balance tries against the score threshold, choosing when to flip coins to maximize points. The increasing thresholds in higher levels add challenge and replayability.
Engagement: The timer-based reveal (2.5 seconds) creates anticipation, while clear win/loss feedback keeps players motivated to progress through levels.
Accessibility: The simple click-based mechanic, clear visual cues, and mute option make Sign Orange Coin approachable for all skill levels, with a short learning curve and engaging citrus-flavored gameplay loop.
